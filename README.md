Welcome to my STAT545 private repository. This repository will primarily contain the study materials and assignments associated with [STAT545](http://stat545.com/Classroom/).

#About me

My name is **Seevasant (Seeva) Indran**. I am from Kuala lumpur, Malaysia :malaysia:. I came to Vancouver in September 2017 to pursue a Masters in **Genome Science and Technology (GSAT)**. I did my undergraduate in Melbourne, Australia. I have previously worked on projects exploring bacteriophages associated _Helicobacter pylori_ genetic plasticity and their association in Gastric cancer at the Marshall center and Intergrin mechanotransduction in Mesenchymal Stem cell at the Tissue Engineering Group, University of Malaya. 

If you are interested, my publications are below:-

| **Publication** | **Link** |
|:----------------:|:------------:|
| Helicobacter pylori Genetic Diversity and Gastro-duodenal Diseases in Malaysia  | [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5377019/pdf/srep07431.pdf) |
| Potential of apoptotic pathway-targeted cancer therapeutic research: Where do we stand?      | [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/cddis2015275)  |


I am currently attached to the [**Loewen lab**](http://www.loewenlab.ca/research-scope/) which is located at the Life Science Institute working on evaluating the significance of unknown variances in cancer drivers using _Sacharomyces Cerevisiae_ (yeast) as a model organism.

Besides being a nerd I also enjoy:-

- Playing the Guitar, picture of me playing the guitar in 
- Cooking and experimenting with new dishes
- Playing Soccer

If you are looking to jam, [this](https://soundcloud.com/seevasantindran/random-solo-trial/s-C5r8F) and [this](https://soundcloud.com/seevasantindran/fine/s-cLzvk) is a random recording of me playing the guitar and should give you an idea of what i can bring in the jamming session as a guitarist.

## Why am I in this course ? 

Learning `r` and and learning how to use the `ggplot` package is an essential part for data exploration in high-throughput biology. As such the [STAT545](http://stat545.com/Classroom/) class would offer me some experience in gaining some ground and work my expertise towards being familiar with data exploration tools. My goals towards the end of this class is hopefully being able to produce genome wide interaction nodes (shown below) with some data from our lab.

and hopefully be able to turn it into something like this for just cause its :sunglasses:

My primary passion is to seek out the mysteries and the intricacies that are allusively governing the universe. As such I have chosen biology as a platform of my curiosity. With modern expedition, enormous data's are generated and I hope to excel with moderate proficiency in this course to instill better sense into my explorations.
